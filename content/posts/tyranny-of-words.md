Here's a metaphor that may be useful to understand why miscommunication happens so often. 
Words are thin labels, reflecting reality. 
They are colored and reflect reality differently based on perspective.

# Boo! That's not helpful!
It is easy to underestimate the extent to which this is true. 
The emotional coloring of a word can vary drastically person to person; in addition to differences in objective meaning or nuance. 
*So what are some ways to avoid miscommunication?*

## Suspend Judgement
* Be aware of any emotional baggage you have associated with a word
* Don't jump to conclusions or assume implications given the choice of words
* Focus on listening, keeping emotional and intellectual distance from the words until the other person has finished their thought(s)

## Iterate, Triangulate
* Practice active listening, repeating in your own words what you believe the other person is trying to communicate
* Watch carefully for unexpected reactions; deep dive on these points
* Eventually you'll feel "in sync" or "on the same page"; rapport will abound

## Beware Charlatans
Different groups of people often agree on the meanings of words, for example political constituents of a particular party. 
Words or phrases take on their own life, laden with emotion. 
All of the weight is given to a particular perspective, usually blind to other interests, nuance, qualifications, and relative importance. 
Remember people are easier to control when they are upset or panicked. 
Always think critically for yourself, keeping in mind the interests of the speaker - or the (often invisible) interest(s) controlling the person casting the words. 

## Summary

Recognize words for what they are. 
Just abstract pointers through a narrow perspective to some fluid reality. 
They are indispensible as a tool, just be careful to not let them control you.
